Fifth entry (17/1/2021 3:50pm – 5:00pm (75 minutes)):
Today I solved the 6 problem. Last time I thought that I would use for loops and then use another number to represent the results. Today I realized that I was not quite on track. So today I redrew my diagram and I came up with a better solution. What I did was assign two variables with the value 0, one of them is for the sum of the square of the number, the other is for the square of the sum of the numbers. So afterwards, I used a for loop to add numbers to the first variable, then squared it. I used another for loop to add squared numbers to the second variable. I could have just left it at that, but I wanted to add another small piece of code to make the problem easier to solve. So an if statement that makes sure y is greater than x, before I use y – x to calculate the difference. If x is greater than y, then x – y to get the result. 

I also started on the next problem, which was harder than I expected. I drew diagrams and tried to simplify the whole process. I think that I have a good grasp on this problem, though I was not able to figure out why my code was not executing as expected.
